The car was unveiled in 1999 at the Auto Show in Detroit . The letter "X" means that the car has all-wheel drive , and the number "5" means that the 5th series ( BMW E39 ) served as the base , but the X5 is shorter than the E39, but higher and wider. The E53 body resembles the BMW E46 Touring . The machine is adapted for driving on all types of pavement; this is due to its large clearance and permanent all-wheel drive.</td>
